Dotfiles

neovim:
- Install packer first (AUR package in arch via yay
- Intall ripgrep or else the one command wont work
- Null-ls?

i3:
- Picom needed?
- background image needed
- hotkeys for discord/brave/obsidian/kitty

tmux:
- This one pretty straightforward I think

zshrc:
- Need ohmyzsh, installed with yay I think???
- Powerlevel10k install was weird, didn't do it through theme but through git
- Installed the necessary fonts by downloading ttfs from powerlevel10k git and using [this guide](https://www.unixtutorial.org/how-to-install-ttf-fonts-in-linux/).
- plugins need to be installed using git, idk how to make them work with AUR repos
